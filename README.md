# chess.mjs

I want to rework [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) (v0.13.4) with the following changes:

- Implement Chess960. âœ…
  - Done, but further testing is needed.
- Move to vanilla ES6.
  - Already usable with ES6 but with a simple wrapper.
- Refactor the 2000-line monolith into smaller ES6 classes.
